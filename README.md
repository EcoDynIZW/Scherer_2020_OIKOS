The spatially explicit agent‐based eco‐epidemiological model is based on the study by Kramer‐Schadt et al. (2009) and subsequent modifications by Lange et al. (2012a, b2012b). In the original model transmission is based on nearest‐neighbour group mixing processes, where infection pressure within and between neighbouring groups is based on constant transmission probabilities without movement of the host individuals. The modified version presented here assumes explicit phenomenological, fully imposed movement patterns and mechanistic movement based on individual decisions of hosts. Below we present essential parts of the model necessary for understanding model outcomes. The full model description following the overview, design concepts and details (‘ODD’) protocol (Grimm et al. 2006, 2010) is provided in the Supplementary material Appendix 1. The NetLogo model and the R code to analyse the simulation results are available on Zenodo (Scherer et al. 2019).
